# AI Agent Management Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to effectively manage AI agents in the platform, including creation, configuration, monitoring, and best practices.

## Creating an Agent

### Basic Setup

1. Navigate to the Agents page
2. Click "Create New Agent"
3. Fill in the basic information:
   - Name: A descriptive name for the agent
   - Description: The agent's purpose and responsibilities
   - Type: Select the agent type (shopping, travel, etc.)

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Shopping Assistant",
  "description": "AI assistant for managing office supply purchases",
  "type": "shopping"
}
```

### Spending Controls

Configure spending limits and controls:

1. Daily Spend Limit: Maximum amount per day
2. Monthly Spend Limit: Maximum amount per month
3. Transaction Limits:
   - Maximum transaction amount
   - Amount requiring approval
   - Minimum transaction amount

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "daily_spend_limit": 1000.00,
  "monthly_spend_limit": 5000.00,
  "max_transaction_amount": 500.00,
  "require_approval_above": 200.00,
  "min_transaction_amount": 10.00
}
```

### Merchant Controls

Set up merchant restrictions:

1. Allowed Merchants:
   - Specific merchants the agent can transact with
   - Leave empty to allow all non-blocked merchants

2. Blocked Merchants:
   - Specific merchants the agent cannot transact with
   - High-priority restriction

3. Merchant Categories:
   - Allow or block entire categories
   - Examples: retail, travel, food, entertainment

Example:
```json
{
  "allowed_merchants": [
    "Amazon",
    "Walmart",
    "Office Depot"
  ],
  "blocked_merchants": [
    "UnauthorizedStore"
  ],
  "allowed_merchant_categories": [
    "retail",
    "office_supplies"
  ],
  "blocked_merchant_categories": [
    "gambling",
    "entertainment"
  ]
}
```

## Managing Agents

### Agent Status

Agents can have the following statuses:

1. **Active**: Fully operational
2. **Inactive**: Temporarily disabled

4. **Pending Approval**: Awaiting administrator review

To change an agent's status:
1. Go to the agent's detail page
2. Click "Change Status"
3. Select the new status
4. Provide a reason for the change (required for suspension)

### Transaction Approval

For transactions requiring approval:

1. You'll receive a notification
2. Review the transaction details:
   - Amount
   - Merchant
   - Purpose
   - Risk assessment
3. Approve or reject with comments
4. Set approval preferences:
   - Auto-approve below certain amount
   - Auto-approve specific merchants
   - Require multiple approvers
