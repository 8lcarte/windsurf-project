   Alert Threshold: [Alert sensitivity]
   ```

4. Set permissions and access levels

## Agent Types and Capabilities

### Transaction Validator
- Validates transactions in real-time
- Applies spending policies
- Flags suspicious activities

Configuration options:
```json
{
  "validation_rules": {
    "max_amount": 5000,
    "restricted_categories": ["gambling", "adult"],
    "high_risk_merchants": ["list", "of", "merchants"]
  },
  "alert_settings": {
    "threshold": 0.8,
    "notification_channel": "email"
  }
}
```

### Category Classifier
- Automatically categorizes transactions
- Maintains merchant database
- Updates spending analytics
- Provides category insights

Configuration options:
```json
{
  "categories": {
    "retail": ["shopping", "department stores"],
    "dining": ["restaurants", "fast food"],
    "travel": ["airlines", "hotels"]
  },
  "learning_mode": "active",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.9
}
```

### Spending Analyzer
- Analyzes spending patterns
- Generates insights
- Identifies saving opportunities
- Provides budget recommendations

Configuration options:
```json
{
  "analysis_period": "monthly",
  "comparison_basis": "previous_period",
  "insight_types": [
    "spending_trends",
    "merchant_analysis",
    "category_breakdown"
  ]
}
```

## Monitoring and Management

### Dashboard Overview
The agent dashboard provides:
- Active agent status
- Performance metrics
- Recent decisions
- Alert history

### Key Metrics
1. Performance Metrics
   - Decision accuracy
   - Response time
   - Processing volume
   - Error rate

2. Operational Metrics
   - Uptime
   - Resource usage
   - Queue length
   - Batch processing time

### Alert Management
Configure alerts for:
- High-risk transactions
- Unusual patterns
- System errors
- Performance issues

Alert settings example:
```json
{
  "risk_threshold": 0.8,
  "notification_channels": ["email", "sms"],
  "alert_frequency": "immediate",
  "quiet_hours": {
    "start": "22:00",
    "end": "06:00"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Configuration
1. Start Conservative
   - Begin with strict rules
   - Gradually relax as confidence grows
   - Monitor impact of changes

2. Regular Review
   - Weekly performance review
   - Monthly rule updates
   - Quarterly strategy assessment

3. Testing Changes
   - Use test transactions
   - Monitor false positives
   - Track accuracy improvements

### Performance Optimization
1. Rule Refinement
   - Remove redundant rules
   - Optimize rule order
   - Update thresholds

2. Resource Management
   - Balance load across agents
   - Schedule intensive tasks
   - Monitor resource usage

3. Error Handling
   - Define fallback behaviors
   - Set up retry logic
   - Maintain audit logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. High False Positive Rate
   Solution:
   - Review rule thresholds
   - Update category mappings
   - Adjust confidence levels

2. Slow Response Time
   Solution:
   - Check resource allocation
   - Optimize rule processing
   - Review API quotas

3. Inconsistent Decisions
   Solution:
   - Audit rule conflicts
